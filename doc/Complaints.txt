This file contains all of the stuff that annoyed me while I coded and felt I needed to write down
why my code suffered for it.
This is a nonessential file to read.


I would have preffered to have better namespace encapsulation, as it stands now there is only a
proposal for namespace visibility and so I have to just accept that i will export everything in my
namespace.

I would really like there to be an array of type for php but i guess i have to suffer.

English uses Review as a noun and a verb which means I use the word review for a method and a class.

I really should have written better oo code. If i had better use of getters setters and visibility
then I could avoid the situation I am in now where the code is only useable if you have a complete
understanding on how the dataclasses works.

as an extension on above, if i had written better code I may have been able to write a generic page
which could be generate d for both collections and items but instead i had to write two different
pages because i'm bad at coding.

I think that i misused the singleton design pattern. Although it makes sense because of the
semantics i still ended up just mostly using it for global variables.

I ended up running out of time for proper commenting and css.
